# Project Specification: Grid SaaS

## 1. Overview
Grid is a multi-tenant SaaS platform that enables barbershops to create professional booking websites with organized scheduling.
**Goal:** Deliver a structured, precise booking experience where each barbershop has its own branded page with a unique URL, maximizing SEO scores via Server-Side Rendering (SSR). Grid brings order to appointment management through smart calendar organization and international booking support.

## 2. Tech Stack & Requirements Mapping
* **Runtime & Package Manager:** **Bun** (Fast installation and native test runner).
* **Core Framework:** **Next.js 14+** (App Router).
* **Language:** **TypeScript** (Type safety for Prisma and Redux).
* **UI & Styling:**
    * **Tailwind CSS** (Utility-first styling).
    * **Shadcn/ui** (Base components).
    * **Sonner** (Toast notifications for feedback).
* **State Management:** **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**
    * *Purpose:* Global Theme management, real-time preview for the customizer, and persistent tenant configuration.
* **Database & ORM:** **Prisma** + **PostgreSQL**.
* **Authentication:** **Supabase Auth**.
* **HTTP Client:** **Axios** (Service Layer pattern for API/Server Actions).

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Database Strategy
* **Local Development:** **PostgreSQL** running in a **Docker Container** or **Supabase CLI** (local emulation).
* **Production:** **Supabase** (Managed PostgreSQL).
* **ORM:** **Prisma** for type-safe queries and migrations.
* **Tenant Isolation:** Application-Level Isolation using `barberShopId` on all related entities (`Service`, `Barber`, `Booking`).

### 3.2 Authentication & Multi-tenancy
* **Provider:** **Supabase Auth**.
* **Identity Logic:** Users (Owners) are linked to a `BarberShop` record.
* **Security:** Session must include `barberShopId` to ensure owners only access their respective dashboard data.

### 3.3 Storage Strategy
* **Service:** **Supabase Storage**.
* **Usage:** Hosting Barber profile pictures and BarberShop logos.
* **Integration:** Next.js Image optimization with Supabase URL loader.

### 3.4 Theming Engine (Redux Powered)
* **Mechanism:** Dynamic CSS Variables (`--primary`, `--secondary`, etc.) injected at the root layout.
* **RTK Slices:** `themeSlice` handles real-time updates for the customizer preview.
